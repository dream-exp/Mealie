# * Borrowed from the <tt>websocket-rack</tt>
#   Gem as a temporary workaround for the
#   timeout problem.
#
# Modified Thin command line interface script.
# This is fallback for WebSocket-Rack.
# Use it when you have EventMachine version < 1.0.0
# Rationale:
#   Older versions of EM have bug that prevent to
#   clearing connection inactivity once it's set.
#   This one will set connection timeout to 0 at
#   default, so there will be no need to overwrite it.
#   Be aware that this will also change inactivity
#   timeout for "normal" connection, so it will be
#   easy to make DoS attack.

*** Deprecation Notice***

The thin-socketrails executable is now deprecated and
will be removed in the next release. 

You may use the regular thin executable to launch the 
server now. 

Other EventMachine based web servers should now be
supported but have not yet been tested.
